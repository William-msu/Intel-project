Green Energy Data Analysis for Data Center Site Selection
Project Overview

This project analyzes green energy potential across various U.S. states to support sustainable data center site selection as part of a hypothetical green initiative for Intel. The goal was to identify states with sufficient renewable energy capacity to meet data center energy demands, aiding in the development of environmentally sustainable infrastructure.
Objectives

    Evaluate U.S. states based on green energy availability and relevant sustainability metrics.
    Identify regions with renewable energy sources capable of supporting large-scale data centers.
    Visualize findings through charts and figures that present data insights on green energy infrastructure.

Project Scope

This analysis was conducted as part of a portfolio project. All data and analysis reflect a personal academic exercise and are not affiliated with Intel.
Methodology

    Data Collection: Compiled and cleaned datasets provided by a training program,
    focusing on renewable energy sources and infrastructure metrics by state.
    
    Data Analysis: Used SQL and Python to process and analyze 
    the data, highlighting states with high green energy suitability.
    
    Data Visualization: Created visualizations to represent findings,
    with a focus on metrics like renewable energy production, consumption rates, and energy policy support.

Technologies Used

    SQL for data retrieval and cleaning.
    Tableau for data visualization.

Results

The analysis identified Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Illinois as the top states with sufficient green energy production to meet data center sustainability requirements. These states demonstrate the renewable energy capacity necessary for large-scale data operations, making them viable options for sustainable infrastructure development.
